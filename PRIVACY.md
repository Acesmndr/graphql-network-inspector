GraphQL Network Inspector (GNI) does not collect any data of any kind.

- GNI has no home server.
- GNI doesn't embed any analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.
- GNI doesn't use any third-party services that might collect data.
- The only point data can leave GNI is when you click "Export" to open a new tab to graphdev.app. Exported data is not sent to graphdev.app servers and only exists within your browser. Only by clicking "Save" on graphdev.app does data leave your machine, data stored on graphdev.app is encrypted.

GitHub is used to host the GNI project. GitHub, Inc. (a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation) owns GitHub and is unrelated to GNI.
