Must have

- Unit tests
- Set default tab when opening websocket view - in case of 3/4 tab open
- Add x mins ago time to each message
- Add subscription to filters and update design to fit
- handle messages with variables
- Only add data payloads to messages. Format messages.

Nice to have

- Try to improve some repeated code
- General tidy up needed
- Allow sorting of messages by time ascending/descending
